### Hi there, I'm Hilario, Physics of Data student at University of Padua ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on density maps generation for crowd counting and localization using Deep Learning techniques.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about systems in thermodynamic equilibrium and out of equilibrium, diffusion processes, and, more in general, about the physics of complex systems.
-âš¡ In my free time I read tech articles and go hiking.
